# Android-Target-Shooter

This Android app is part of a project for the course Mobile User Interfaces at York University.

The purpose of this game is to record performance and allow comparison between two control methods. After a round, results are displayed on screen and recorded in a text file in the "Podcasts" folder of the device.


## Practice Mode
Toggling practice mode disables logging of performance to device storage. Results are still displayed at the end of a round.
